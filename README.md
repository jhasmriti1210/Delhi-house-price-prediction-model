# Delhi-house-price-prediction-model
This project uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict property prices in Delhi. It takes input features such as the number of bedrooms (BHK), total square footage (sqft), and number of bathrooms to provide accurate price estimates, aiding buyers and sellers in making informed real estate decisions.

# Features
1) Predicts house prices using a Random Forest regression model.
2) Supports a variety of input features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.
3) Highly accurate predictions due to the robustness of the Random Forest algorithm.
4) Easy-to-use interface for training the model and making predictions.

# How It Works
Data Processing: Cleans and preprocesses the dataset to handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables.
Model Training: Uses the Random Forest algorithm to train a regression model on the processed data.
Prediction: The trained model takes input features(size(in bhk), total_sqft, no. of bathrooms) and predicts the corresponding house price.
